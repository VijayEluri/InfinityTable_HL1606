Introduction
------------

Arduino project for my [Infinity](pics) [Table][vid].  Uses my HL1606 [library][lib]; that page also lists some of the components used to build the table.  If you're on a Mac, you can install Arduino, then run the janky install.sh script to download and symlink the dependent libraries into ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries.
